## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [CSS Modules Stylesheet](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet) - For styles

### What I learned x Continued Development

Well, since the project is still a work in progress, there's yet a lot to learn.
So far it was possible to practice HTML5, CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, and the CSS Modles Stylessheet.

Next steps are:
- Add responsiveness with Media Query
- Add the hover focus states

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - A guide to flexbox is a constant visit. There's always something to improve on this matter.
- [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Same here.
